            Add agave syrup and tomato paste and mix everything well.

            <strong>Add the canned tomatoes</strong> to the vegetables and press them down carefully with a spatula. 
            Add water and mix well. Simmer gently for <strong>10-15 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Use a spoon to make four small wells in the sauce and carefully break in the eggs. 
            Season eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place the lid on the pan and cook the 
            eggs, <strong>covered</strong>, over low heat for <strong>6-8 minutes</strong> , until the whites are set and the yolks 
            are still relatively runny.
